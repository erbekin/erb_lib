# erb_lib

**ERB** is an open-source, multi-platform, modern C++ library designed to handle _everything_ — from core systems to experimental madness.

This project aims to provide a modular, scalable, and lightweight C++ library built with modern architecture and clean design principles. Whether you're prototyping a toy engine or building production-level software, `erb_lib` strives to be your go-to utility layer.

## 🚀 Goals

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Clean and maintainable codebase using C++17/20/23 features
- Zero dependencies by default
- Lightweight, fast compile-times
- Modular and extensible architecture
